### 🔍 About Me

I’m Jayashree Ramesh Reddy, a Data Science master’s student at the University of Memphis, skilled in transforming complex data into actionable insights. I leverage powerful tools like Python, SQL, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to build and deploy intelligent models, while using Power BI, Tableau, and Matplotlib to create compelling visual stories. With experience in classification, clustering, time series forecasting, and deep learning, I focus on bridging business goals with cutting-edge technology. I’m passionate about delivering scalable models and clear insights that drive decision-making and innovation.
